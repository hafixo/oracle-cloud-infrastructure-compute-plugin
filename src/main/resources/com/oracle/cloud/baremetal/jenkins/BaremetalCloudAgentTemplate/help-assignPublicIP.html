  <ul>
   <li>Each Agent has at least one private IP address and at least one optional public IP address. A private IP address enables the Agent to communicate with other Agents inside the VCN, or with hosts in your on-premises network (via an IPSec VPN or Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect). A public IP address enables the Agent to communicate with hosts on the internet.</li>
   <li>By default, the Plugin will assign a public IP to an Agent, provided the subnet has an available public IP range. If this Option is unchecked, only the private IP is assigned. </li>
