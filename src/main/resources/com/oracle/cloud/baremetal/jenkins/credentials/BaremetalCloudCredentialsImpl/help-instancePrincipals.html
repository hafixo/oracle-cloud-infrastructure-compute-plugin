You can authorize an instance to make API calls in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services. 
After you set up the required resources and policies in OCI, an application running on an instance can call OCI public services, removing the need to configure user credentials or a configuration file.
If using this functionality, and check this Option, only the Tenant Id and Region Fields are required.
